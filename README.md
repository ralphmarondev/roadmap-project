# **Mobile Development Roadmap - Graduation Countdown**

Welcome to the Mobile Development Roadmap! This project is a structured guide designed to help you, a soon-to-be Computer Engineer, enhance your mobile development skills over the next **8 months** until graduation. The focus is on building practical skills, working with industry-standard tools, and preparing for job readiness.

## 📅 **Roadmap Overview**

This roadmap is split into four manageable phases, ensuring consistent progress across essential mobile development areas:

1. **Strengthen Current Skills (1-2 months)**
   - Refactor existing projects to follow best practices.
   - Dive deeper into Jetpack Compose and Room database usage.
  
2. **Expand Key Tools and Patterns (2-4 months)**
   - Learn Retrofit for networking.
   - Introduce state management with StateFlow and SharedFlow.
   - Understand Dependency Injection with Dagger Hilt.
  
3. **Work on Capstone or Graduation Projects (4-6 months)**
   - Develop a significant project that incorporates learned skills.
   - Implement features such as user authentication and data storage.
  
4. **Job Preparation and Portfolio Building (6-8 months)**
   - Polish existing projects and focus on building a compelling portfolio.
   - Prepare for job interviews by practicing coding challenges and soft skills.

## 🚀 **Technologies & Tools Covered**
- **Jetpack Compose**: Build intuitive and responsive UI for Android apps.
- **Room Database**: Implement local storage for offline access.
- **ViewModel**: Manage app-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **Retrofit**: Handle networking and API requests efficiently.
- **StateFlow/SharedFlow**: Improve state management in your applications.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensure code reliability and minimize bugs.
- **Dependency Injection (Dagger Hilt)**: Simplify dependency management.
  
## 🏗️ **Project Architecture**
The recommended project structure follows **Clean Architecture** principles, using **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** to separate concerns and promote testability. Multi-module setups are encouraged for scalability.

### Example Structure:
